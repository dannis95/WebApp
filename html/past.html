        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Video game stories are unique by nature, given they have to account for what type of game it is. Multiplayer games rarely have a "story mode, perse, but single player games are almost exclusively story. A good example of this is God of War 2018, renowned for its excellent story. Allow me to explain how this game handles the "Heros Journey."</h3>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2>Part 1 : Call to Adventure</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>The game begins with our protagonist, Kratos, getting the definition of a "Call to Adventure." Baldur, a god who cant be killed naturally, picks a fight with him, much to Kratos' disappointment.</h3>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2>Part 2 : Meeting the Mentor</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>The game progresses for a bit, then you end up face to face with the "smartest man alive," Mimir. After a brief mission where you cut off his head and revive him, he remains at Kratos' side for the rest of the game. He serves as a form of mentor for Kratos (Albeit at first unwanted), and to an extent Atreus. As the game progresses, Kratos begins to respect his judgement and treat him as an extended part of the family.</h3>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2>Part 3 : Crossing the Threshold</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>There is no "threshold," in a sense. The closest we get to this is being told by Mimir that the current mountain they stand upon is not the tallest in all the realms. Mimir then proceeds to inform them that the highest peak remains in Jotunheim, a realm of giants that was closed off to all. Fortunately, the last remaining gate to Jotunheim remains at that peak, but they must recieve a chisel to carve a sending rune to gain acess.</h3>

            <h2>Part 4 : Helper / Trial + Failure</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>A perfect example of this would be the Magni and Modi boss fight, testing both of our characters will. Atreus shows to be lacking in disipline, as he lashes out against them when commenting on his late mother. Kratos, already familiar with this form of verbal insult, doesnt give them the reaction they want. The end result of this boss fight is Magni falls in battle to Kratos. Modi is visibly shook, and Atreus takes the time to rub it in as Modi flees battle.</h3>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2>Part 5 : New Skills</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>Due to the part mentioned above, Modi interupts both of our protagonists by occupying Kratos with a constant stream of lightning to him, as Atreus is powerless to watch. This results in Atreus losing control of himself, and putting himself in a form of coma. Unsurprisingly, this results in Kratos powering through Modi's attack, and seeking the aid of Freya, the one who revived Mimir. To recieve a cure, he must go to the realm of Helheim, where "no magic in the nine realms can create a blaze." Kratos has been carrying a frost axe, left by his late wife, for the game. However, he has another weapon, the Blades of Chaos, that still burn with a fire unlike anything in the Norse realm. This serves as a new ability, and a direct confrontation of Kratos' past.</h3>

            <h2>Part 6 : Death / Rebirth</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>There isnt a "Death / Revival," but a dramatic cange regardless. Once Kratos has cured Atreus, the latter believes himself to be unwanted by Kratos, and believes he knows the truth. Kratos then continues to tell him of his (and by proxy Atreus) his form of being a god. Atreus takes the news pretty badly at first, as he becomes very noticably arrogant and rash. This of course is addressed by Kratos, very firmly, after a brief encounter with Baldur once again.</h3>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2>Part 7 : Revelation</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>After a final battle with Baldur, they realise he was never sent to find Kratos, he was sent to find his late wife. She was a giant, and that meant she was a target for the all-father Odin, and his children of the Aesir. We also find out that by proxy, Atreus is a giant, whomst his people called "Loki."</h3>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2>Part 8 : Finally Changes</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>With all cards on the table, Kratos then begins to open up about his past to Atreus, telling him of his past sins. Kratos then ends the conversation with "We must be better."</h3>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2>Part 9 : Atonement</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>This "atonement" is quite literal, for Kratos now has nothing to hide from Atreus. He symbolically removes the cloth on his arms, revealing the scars on burning chains from his past.</h3>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2>Part 10 : Recieve Gift</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3></h3>
        <br>
        <center>
            <h2>Part 11 : Return Changed</h2>
        </center>
        <br>
        <h3>As the credits roll, Kratos and Atreus return home. Kratos even sharing a story on why Atreus was named "Atreus." Once they get home, they finally rest. But in a dream, Atreus has a vision of Thor coming to meet them, this vision will be realised in the next game.</h3>
